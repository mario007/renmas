## This scene defines the standard "Cornell Box"...  with a few caveats.             ##
## Caveats:                                                                          ##
##     1) The light color is defined in arbitrary RGB units rather than              ##
##        the physically measured spectrum described on the Cornell Box page         ##
##        (http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/box/data.html)                     ##
##     2) The light is defined as a point (instead of a quad with points             ##
##        of (343,548.7,227), (343,548.7,332), (213,548.7,332) and (213,548.7,227)   ##
##        and a surface normal of (0,-1,0))                                          ##
##     3) Materials are defined with RGB approximations to their spectral            ##
##        reflectance, not the 4 nm sampled spectra on the web page.                 ##
##                                                                                   ##
